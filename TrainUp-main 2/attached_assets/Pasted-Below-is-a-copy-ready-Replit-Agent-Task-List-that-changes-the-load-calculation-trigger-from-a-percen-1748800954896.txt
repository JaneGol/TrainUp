Below is a copy-ready Replit-Agent Task List that changes the load-calculation trigger from a percentage check to a fixed threshold: “more than 3 athletes submitted.”
Nothing else in the system is altered.

# Replit-Agent Task · Switch RPE threshold to “> 3 athletes”

## 0 ▸ File to patch
* db/triggers.sql   (function `sync_rpe_participants` or equivalent)

## 1 ▸ Replace >40 % check with absolute count
```diff
- -- old: percentage threshold
- IF (rpe_participants::NUMERIC / NULLIF(total_athletes,0)) > 0.4 THEN
+ -- new: absolute threshold (>3 submissions)
+ IF rpe_participants > 3 THEN
Keep same numeric cast inside load formula

 new_load := avg_rpe * emo_coeff * duration * type_coeff
-             * (rpe_participants::NUMERIC / NULLIF(total_athletes,1));
+             * (rpe_participants::NUMERIC / NULLIF(total_athletes,1));
(No change needed—the scaling by participants / total remains valid.)

2 ▸ Re-trigger today’s session to reflect new rule
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Example: fire trigger for 1-Jun Gym (id = X)
UPDATE rpe_submissions
   SET updated_at = NOW()
 WHERE session_id = X
 LIMIT 1;
(If you don’t know X, first query
SELECT id FROM training_sessions WHERE session_date='2025-06-01' AND type='Gym';)

3 ▸ Verify
SELECT session_date, rpe_participants, load FROM training_sessions WHERE id = X;

If rpe_participants > 3 → load is now > 0 AU.

Refresh coach UI → Training Log & Weekly Training Load show updated AU.

4 ▸ Commit message
chore(threshold): require >3 RPE submissions (not 40 %) to compute session load

**Result**

* Any session with **4 or more** athlete RPE submissions instantly gets its training load computed.  
* Training Log shows accurate “X / N” counts; Weekly Training Load & ACWR charts update immediately after the 4th submission.  
* All other logic, formulas, and UI remain unchanged.
