Title
Add explanatory tooltip for Variability Index (Training Monotony → Advanced Workload Metrics)

Objective
Help coaches interpret the Variability Index (VI) by displaying a concise, science-based explanation and threshold guidance directly in the Training Monotony block.

Copy to show (one paragraph, line-wrapped in UI):

Variability Index (VI) compares the day-to-day spread of training load within the week (standard deviation ÷ mean).
• 0.8 – 1.3 = desirable range – balanced variety that supports adaptation.
• < 0.8 = too uniform/monotonous – can build hidden fatigue.
• > 1.3 = highly erratic – big swings may elevate injury & illness risk.

(No numbers are recalculated; this is purely an explanatory overlay.)

Scope of Change
Layer	File(s) / Component(s)	Required edit
Front-end (React)	src/metrics/TrainingMonotony/VariabilityIndex.tsx (or inline in TrainingMonotonyCard.tsx)	• Add an info icon / “?” badge alongside the Variability Index label.
• On hover or tap, render the paragraph above in a tooltip / pop-over (reuse existing Tooltip component).
i18n / Strings	locales/en.json (and other languages)	Add key metrics.vi.tooltip containing the exact paragraph; mark for translation.
Tests	__tests__/variabilityIndex.test.tsx	Verify the tooltip mounts and contains the threshold text.
Storybook (if used)	TrainingMonotony.stories.tsx	Add story with tooltip visible for manual QA.

Do NOT change anything else
• Leave the VI calculation, charts, styling, and thresholds logic untouched.
• Do not adjust other Advanced Workload Metrics blocks.
• Keep component names, props, and analytics events exactly as they are.

Acceptance Criteria
An info icon appears right of the Variability Index label across all breakpoints.

Hover/tap shows the paragraph above, respecting existing tooltip styling.

No console warnings; Lighthouse performance scores unchanged (±1).

All unit tests pass; new test covers tooltip rendering.

Deployed Repl (replit.com/@e89030922661/TrainUp) exhibits the tooltip with no regressions elsewhere.
