Below is a focused “triage + fix” plan you can give the Replit AI-agent.
It pinpoints the two usual culprits when **today’s sessions don’t appear in *either* interface**:

1. **The 50 %-rule** never flips `is_complete = TRUE` for today, so coach and athlete queries skip the row.
2. **Timezone drift**—the SQL groups by UTC day while the UI expects local (IST) day.

Paste the task block into **Ask AI** and the agent will dump the logs, patch the policy, and force-refresh today’s data.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Replit Agent Task – Why is “today” missing in both coach & athlete UI?
# Repo: FormTrack
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1 ▸ Quick DB sanity dump (console)
```sql
-- 1.1  Does the session row exist for today?
SELECT id, session_date, type, session_no,
       participant_cnt, is_complete, session_load
FROM training_sessions
WHERE session_date::date = current_date;          -- server-side date

-- 1.2  How many athletes in team vs submissions?
SELECT t.team_id, t.athletes, s.participant_cnt
FROM team_roster_size  t
JOIN training_sessions s ON s.team_id = t.team_id
WHERE s.session_date::date = current_date;
````

**Log these rows** so we see counts & is\_complete.

---

## 2 ▸ If `participant_cnt / athletes >= 0.5` but is\_complete=false

### 2.1  Trigger bug: update participant\_cnt but not is\_complete

Patch `trg_update_session_avg`:

```plpgsql
UPDATE training_sessions
   SET participant_cnt = _cnt,
       is_complete     = (_cnt::decimal / NULLIF(_team,0)) >= 0.5
 WHERE id = COALESCE(NEW.session_id, OLD.session_id);
```

Then force refresh:

```sql
UPDATE training_sessions SET participant_cnt = participant_cnt WHERE session_date::date = current_date;
```

---

## 3 ▸ If `participant_cnt / athletes < 0.5`

You simply don’t have enough RPE forms yet.
Add a small grey note under the Training Log table:

```tsx
{weekRows.filter(r=>!r.is_complete).length>0 && (
  <p className="text-[11px] text-zinc-400 mt-2">Waiting for more athletes to submit RPE for today…</p>
)}
```

---

## 4 ▸ Time-zone alignment

If the session row’s `session_date` is in UTC and your server day rolled over at 18:30 IST:

1. Pass `X-TZ` header (`Asia/Kolkata`) on every API call.
2. In `/load/week` and `/training/week` queries group by:

   ```sql
   date_trunc('day', session_date AT TIME ZONE :tz)
   ```

---

## 5 ▸ Invalidate caches after RPE submit

```ts
// RpeForm onSuccess
queryClient.invalidateQueries({queryKey:['trainingWeek']});
queryClient.invalidateQueries({queryKey:['weekLoad']});
queryClient.invalidateQueries({queryKey:['acwr30d']});
```

---

## 6 ▸ Final smoke-test script

```bash
# login as athlete -> submit RPE
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X POST /api/rpe ...

# login as coach
curl /api/training/week?team=...
curl /api/load/week?weekStart=$(date +%F)
```

Expect today’s row with correct AU.

---

## 7 ▸ Commit message

> fix(today-missing): update is\_complete logic, group by local date, cache-bust after RPE

```

**Run that task** – after the trigger fix or timezone cast, refresh the browser and today’s Field + Gym numbers will appear in both coach and athlete views.
```
