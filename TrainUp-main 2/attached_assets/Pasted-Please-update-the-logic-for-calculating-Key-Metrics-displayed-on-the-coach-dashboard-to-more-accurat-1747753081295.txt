Please update the logic for calculating Key Metrics displayed on the coach dashboard to more accurately reflect team wellness data submitted by athletes.

1. Recovery
Recovery should represent the average score across all athletes who submitted a response to the question:
“How recovered do you feel?”

This value should be displayed as a team average (e.g., 1–10 scale) in percentage out of 100

2. Readiness
Create a composite Readiness score using a weighted average or combined index from the following individual self-report metrics submitted by athletes:

Sleep quality

Sleep hours

Stress level

Mood

Recovery

Health status

Energy / Motivation

Muscle soreness

Readiness = Average of all available individual scores submitted that day by each athlete.

Display the team average Readiness score, similar to Recovery.

Only include athletes who submitted all required values for that day.

3. High Risk
Mark an athlete as "High Risk" if they meet 2 or more of the following red-flag conditions on the same day:

Risk Criteria (threshold-based):
Sleep duration < 6 hours

Sleep quality ≤ 4 (on 1–10 scale)

Stress level ≥ 7

Mood ≤ 4

Recovery ≤ 4

Energy/motivation ≤ 4

Muscle soreness ≥ 7

Answered “Yes” to "Do you have any symptoms?"

Answered “Yes” to "Do you have an injury?"

The High Risk block shows the total number of athletes flagged today.

This logic should be updated daily based on new athlete submissions.


4. Sick / Injured
If at least one athlete answers “Yes” to “Do you have any symptoms?” in the Recovery & Health section:

Mark the Sick/Injured metric as non-zero (e.g., show the actual number of affected athletes).

This includes both illness symptoms and injury declarations.

Important:
Maintain the current UI design, structure, colors, and styling.

Do not make any other changes outside of the logic driving these three key metrics.

Ensure that calculations update daily based on submitted data and are reflected accurately on the dashboard.

Acceptance Criteria:

Recovery metric reflects average recovery score.

Readiness score is calculated using defined wellness indicators.

Sick/Injured metric reflects true positive responses.

UI remains visually consistent with no layout or styling changes.
