Section: Athlete Status (Coach Interface)
🔧 Objective:
Refine the visual layout and simplify the interface for better clarity and quicker scanning by coaches. All changes must adhere strictly to the app’s existing design system, color palette, and typography.

✏️ Changes to the "7-Day Team Wellness Trends" Block:
Smaller Percentage Labels:

Reduce font size of percentage values shown on the chart

Apply lower opacity (e.g., 60–70%) to make them visually softer

Date Labels:

Add date labels below the chart (one for each of the last 7 days)

Format: DD.MM (e.g., 15.05)

Use the same smaller font size and opacity as the percentages

Metric Labels:

Reduce font size of metric labels: Readiness, Mood, Recovery

Ensure font weight and spacing match app standards for secondary text

✏️ Changes Below the Trends Block:
Remove Search Bar:

Delete the athlete search input field entirely from this screen

Simplify Data View Options:

Remove the option to toggle between List or Table

Keep only the icon grid as the display method

✏️ Changes to the Athlete Icon Grid:
Redesign Athlete Icons:

Remove all internal labels or text from the athlete icons

Convert icon shape to a clean square tile

Layout:

Left side: athlete’s avatar (or initials if no photo)

Right side: stack of 3 horizontal bars/indicators

Horizontal Status Indicators:

Display 3 bars next to each athlete:

Readiness

Mood

Recovery

Each bar includes:

A label (text outside the bar, aligned left)

A color-filled bar representing the athlete’s current level (risk/condition)

Use app’s existing color scheme to indicate status (e.g., green = good, red = high risk)

📌 Design & Style Guidelines:
All visual updates must fully comply with the app’s existing design system:

Font sizes and weights must match the app’s hierarchy

Use established color tokens for statuses (green/yellow/red/gray)

Maintain uniform spacing, alignment, padding, and component sizing

Ensure mobile responsiveness and grid flexibility
