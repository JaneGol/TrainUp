Title
Add visual training-type indicator to the RPE button after today's submission

Objective
When an athlete has logged RPE for today, update the RPE button on the athlete home screen to show:

A “Completed Today” label

A small icon indicating the type of session logged today

This mirrors the behavior of the Self-Control Diary button and gives the athlete clear, immediate visual feedback on what they submitted.

Training Types & Icons
Training Type	Icon Description	Example (if using system icons / SVG)
Field Training	Small field or cone icon	icon-training-field.svg or icon-cones.svg
Gym	Barbell or dumbbell icon	icon-barbell.svg
Match / Game	Whistle, scoreboard, or jersey	icon-game.svg or icon-jersey.svg

✅ If two field sessions are logged in one day, still show the Field Training icon once (we only display one icon per day).

Display Logic
If RPE submitted today:

Button displays:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[icon] Completed Today
Example:

🏟️ Completed Today → (replaced with system field icon)

🏋️ Completed Today → (replaced with gym icon)

🎮 Completed Today → (replaced with match/game icon)

If no RPE for today → button remains unchanged.

Icons appear left of label text, with same sizing/margin as used in Self-Control Diary.

Scope of Change
Layer	File(s) / Component(s)	Required edit
Front-end	AthleteHomeScreen.tsx or RpeButton.tsx	1. Detect if RPE submitted today.
2. Check session type → prioritize: Match > Gym > Field if multiple exist.
3. Render corresponding SVG icon + "Completed Today" text.
Assets / Icons	assets/icons/	Import or reference system icons:
• training-field.svg
• barbell.svg
• match.svg (or equivalents used in app)
Styles	Existing button label classes	Reuse styles from Diary button (font, padding, alignment). Icon should be small (16–20px) and vertically centered with text.
i18n / Strings	locales/en.json	Add (if not present):

json
Copy
Edit
"rpe.completedToday": "Completed Today"
``` |
| Tests | `rpeButton.test.tsx` | Add test cases for RPE submitted today with each training type. Confirm correct icon appears. |

> **Do NOT change anything else**  
> • Do not edit Diary button, training form, session types, or analytics.  
> • No layout shifts, refactors, or new libraries.  
> • Leave existing styling and navigation unchanged.

### Acceptance Criteria  

1. After an athlete logs RPE for today:
   - RPE button updates to show: **[correct icon] Completed Today**
2. Correct icon displays based on training type:
   - Match > Gym > Field (priority if multiple)
3. Button appearance matches visual style of Self-Control Diary:
   - Font size, spacing, mobile-friendly layout
4. No changes if RPE is not submitted today.
5. All test cases pass; Repl (**[replit.com/@e89030922661/TrainUp](https://replit.com/@e89030922661/TrainUp)**) shows icons correctly.
6. Lighthouse and performance scores unchanged.

### Roll-out / Replicas  
Apply this visual-only change to all replicas of the *TrainUp* codebase. **No other behavior or styling should be touched.**
