Sure—here’s a **copy-and-paste “Replit Agent Task List.”**
Drop everything inside the grey block into the **Ask AI** panel in your *SportsMindTracker* Repl and hit **Send**.
The agent will swap the **“LOW READINESS”** card for a **“SICK / INJURED”** card that shows the count and links to the filtered Athlete-Status view.

# 🚀  Replit Agent Task – Replace “Low Readiness” card with “Sick / Injured”
# Repo: https://replit.com/@e89030922661/SportsMindTracker

## Goal
Show coaches how many athletes are currently flagged as sick or injured, in place of the old “Low Readiness” box.

## 1. Update MainMetrics UI
- **File:** `src/pages/coach/MainMetrics.tsx`
- Remove the card whose heading is “LOW READINESS”.
- Add a new card using the snippet below (place it where the old one was).

```tsx
/* ▼ NEW 4th CARD — paste inside the grid --------------------------------- */
import { HeartPulse } from "lucide-react";   // add up-top with other icons

<Card className="bg-red-600/80"
      onClick={() => nav('/athlete-status?filter=sick')}>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-1">
    <HeartPulse size={18} className="text-red-300" />
    <p className="text-xs uppercase text-white/60">
      Sick&nbsp;/&nbsp;Injured
    </p>
  </div>

  <p className="text-3xl font-extrabold text-red-100 mt-1">
    {m.data.sick}
  </p>

  <p className="text-xs">Tap to view</p>
</Card>
/* ▲ NEW CARD -------------------------------------------------------------- */
````

(Keep the other three cards—Recovery, Readiness, High-Risk—unchanged.)

## 2. CSS / Tailwind

No new utilities needed; `bg-red-600/80` and `text-red-100` are Tailwind defaults.

## 3. Routing

Clicking the card navigates to
`/athlete-status?filter=sick`
This route already exists (same logic previously used for the High-Risk card).

## 4. Clean-up (optional)

* Delete any leftover styles/classes for `.card-lowReady` if present.

## 5. Commit message

> feat(ui): replace Low Readiness card with Sick / Injured count

# End of agent task

```
