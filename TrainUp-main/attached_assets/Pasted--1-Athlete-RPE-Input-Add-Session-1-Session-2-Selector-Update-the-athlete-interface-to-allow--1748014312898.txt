✅ 1. Athlete RPE Input – Add "Session 1 / Session 2" Selector
Update the athlete interface to allow selection of which training session the RPE refers to.

Add a simple dropdown or button toggle:

🔘 Session 1

🔘 Session 2

Default: Session 1

Reason: Many athletes perform 2 sessions per day. These must be counted separately in all load calculations.

🟡 Important: All submitted RPEs must include a session_number field (1 or 2) to distinguish them.

✅ 2. Coach Interface – Replace “Add Training” with Automated View
Rename the existing "Add Training" section to:

"Team Sessions This Week" (or: “Session Overview”, “Weekly Training Log”)

What it shows:

A list of detected sessions, based on athlete RPE submissions:

✅ A session appears if more than 50% of athletes submitted RPE for it

✅ Multiple RPEs per day = multiple sessions

✅ Each session includes:

📅 Date

🏷 Type (Field, Gym)

⏱ Duration (default = 60 min, editable by coach)

👥 Submission count

Coach can manually edit the duration (simple numeric field)

🟢 This section feeds data directly into the ACWR calculation system.

✅ 3. Normalization Logic for ACWR
To reflect different impact of session types:

Session Type	Weight
Field	1.25x
Gym	1.0x
Recovery	0.5x (optional)

Use this weighting when computing acute and chronic load values for ACWR.

✅ 4. Load Insights – Visual Enhancement for Multiple Sessions
Keep the existing design and layout of Load Insights, but update the bar chart logic:

If two sessions on the same day, display stacked sections:

🟦 Field + 🟦 Field → split by dashed line

🟦 Field + 🟥 Gym → distinct segments by color

Dashed line = same type, multiple sessions

📌 This makes daily training accumulation visually clear, especially for high-load field days.

⚠️ Notes:
❗ No other visual changes — do not alter layout, colors, or UX elements

Data saved must be structured with:

session_number, date, duration, type, source: "RPE"

All updates must remain lightweight and coach/athlete-friendly in UI
