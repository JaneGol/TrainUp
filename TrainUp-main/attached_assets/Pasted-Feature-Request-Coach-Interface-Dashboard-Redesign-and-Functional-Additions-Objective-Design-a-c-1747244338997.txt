Feature Request: Coach Interface â€“ Dashboard Redesign and Functional Additions
Objective:
Design a clean, streamlined coach interface that mirrors the visual style and color scheme of the athlete interface. It should provide clear insights into athlete status, training load dynamics, and support training management actions.

1. General Design Requirements:
Use the same visual style (dark theme, minimalistic colors, typography, and buttons) as in the athlete interface.

Interface must be responsive and mobile-friendly.

2. Top-Level Summary (Infographic Cards):
Display key metrics from athlete data in card format at the top of the screen:

ðŸ”¹ Average Recovery Level (from athlete diaries)

ðŸ”¹ Average Readiness Score

ðŸ”¹ Number of Athletes at Elevated Risk

ðŸ”¹ Number of Sick or Injured Athletes

ðŸ”¹ Team Training Load (Weekly Total AU)

These should be dynamic, updated daily, and color-coded for quick scanning.

3. Action Buttons (styled like athlete buttons):
Button 1: Athlete Status
Opens a list view: Athlete Status Dashboard

Each athlete row includes:

Name

Recovery score

Readiness level

Status tag:

ðŸŸ¢ Ready

ðŸŸ¡ Elevated Risk

ðŸ”´ Sick / Injured

Data pulled directly from athlete diaries (sleep, soreness, mood, illness, etc.)

Button 2: Add Training
Opens a form to schedule a session for one or multiple athletes.

Fields:

Training Type (dropdown â€“ same as athlete training types)

Duration (in minutes)

Upon saving, the system calculates training load:

ini
Copy code
Load = RPE (athlete input) Ã— Duration
Button 3: Team Load Dashboard (Suggested Name: "Load Insights")
Visual overview of training load dynamics across the team.

Display:

Acute Load (7-day average) per athlete and team average

Chronic Load (28-day average) per athlete and team average

ACWR per athlete and risk level (e.g., 0.8â€“1.3 = optimal)

Suggested layout:

Bar charts for athlete-specific data

Line chart showing team trends over time

Filters: by athlete, time period, position, or group

Button 4: Smart Doctor
Section with AI-driven health and recovery recommendations for athletes.

Display:

List of flagged athletes (based on bad sleep, illness, low recovery)

Icons or tags for issue type (e.g., ðŸ’¤ Poor Sleep, ðŸ¤’ Illness, ðŸ¦µ Injury)

Each athlete entry includes a suggested action plan.

Example Recommendation Templates:

"Monitor closely: Athlete reported poor sleep 3 days in a row. Suggest reduced training intensity."

"Injury reported. Recommend rest for 3â€“5 days and follow-up check-in."

"High chronic load with low recovery â€“ taper recommended."

"Sickness reported. Mark as inactive and reassess in 48 hours."
