Below is a small ‚ÄúReplit Agent Task List‚Äù that will make the **High-Risk, Sick/Injured, and AI Recommendations** cards stretch to exactly the same full-row width as the lime navigation buttons.
Copy everything in the grey box into the **Ask AI** side-panel of your *SportsMindTracker* repl and hit **Send**.

# üöÄ  Replit Agent Task ‚Äì Make 3 metric cards full-row width
# Repo: https://replit.com/@e89030922661/SportsMindTracker

## 1. Component location
The three cards live in **`src/pages/coach/MainMetrics.tsx`** (the block right after the two gauge cards).

## 2. Wrap them in a single full-width grid
Replace the current wrapper (flex or grid) with:

```tsx
<section
  className="w-full grid gap-4
             grid-cols-1        /* mobile: stack */
             sm:grid-cols-1
             md:grid-cols-1">   /* force each card to span full row */
  <Card className="w-full"> ‚Ä¶ High-Risk ‚Ä¶ </Card>
  <Card className="w-full"> ‚Ä¶ Sick/Injured ‚Ä¶ </Card>
  <Card className="w-full"> ‚Ä¶ AI Recommendations ‚Ä¶ </Card>
</section>
````

### Explanation

* `w-full` on **both** the `<section>` and each `<Card>` ensures they occupy 100 % of the available content width (matching the lime buttons below).
* Keeping `grid-cols-1` at all breakpoints means each card gets its own row, but they align edge-to-edge with the other full-width buttons.
* If you still want them in one horizontal row on very wide screens, change the last line to `lg:grid-cols-3`.

## 3. Remove leftover width constraints

If any of the three cards have fixed `max-w`, `flex-basis`, or `inline-block` styling, delete those.

## 4. Quick manual check (agent does after build)

1. Reload coach dashboard.
2. High-Risk, Sick/Injured, and AI cards now fill the width exactly like the lime ‚ÄúAthlete Status‚Äù and ‚ÄúTraining Log‚Äù buttons.
3. No horizontal scrolling; no layout jump on desktop.

## 5. Commit message

> style(dashboard): stretch metric cards to full-row width for visual consistency

# End of agent task
