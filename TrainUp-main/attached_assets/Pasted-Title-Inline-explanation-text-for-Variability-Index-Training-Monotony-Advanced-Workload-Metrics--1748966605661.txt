Title
Inline explanation text for Variability Index (Training Monotony → Advanced Workload Metrics)

Objective
Remove the tooltip/hover hint (not practical on phones) and instead display the threshold guidance directly beneath the Variability Index number, styled exactly like the explanatory text in the neighbouring Training Strain block.

Exact copy to render (keep bullets & em-dash spacing)
bash
Copy
Edit
• 0.8 – 1.3 = desirable range – balanced variety that supports adaptation.
• < 0.8 = too uniform/monotonous – can build hidden fatigue.
• > 1.3 = highly erratic – big swings may elevate injury & illness risk.
Scope of Change
Layer	File(s) / Component(s)	Required edit
Front-end (React)	src/metrics/TrainingMonotony/VariabilityIndex.tsx
(or inline in TrainingMonotonyCard.tsx)	• Delete the existing Tooltip / hover logic.
• Render the three-line bullet text immediately below the VI value.
• Wrap the text with the same Typography / CSS utility classes used for the explanatory blurb in Training Strain so font family, weight, size, and line-height match exactly.
Styles	Global or module CSS (if Training Strain uses a shared class)	• If Training Strain relies on a class like .metric-note, reuse it; otherwise copy its rules into a new .vi-note and apply.
• Do not add new colours, margins, or font sizes—mirror the existing block.
i18n / Strings	locales/en.json (and other languages)	Replace the old tooltip string entries with a single key metrics.vi.note containing the exact three bullet lines.
Tests	__tests__/variabilityIndex.test.tsx	Update the test: assert that the three bullet lines are rendered in the DOM (no tooltip simulation).

Do not change anything else
• Leave the Variability Index calculation and display value untouched.
• Do not alter layouts, grid widths, or other Advanced Workload Metrics.
• Keep component names, props, analytics events, and import paths exactly as they are.
• No dependency bumps or formatting sweeps.

Acceptance Criteria
Mobile and desktop views show the three bullet lines under the VI value, with identical typography to the Training Strain note.

Tapping the block does not reveal any tooltip or extra UI.

No runtime warnings; Lighthouse performance & accessibility scores unchanged (±1).

All unit tests pass, including the updated VI test.
