**Subject: Standardise emotional-load multiplier across all calculations**

Hi team,

We’ve found an inconsistency in how the emotional-load (“emotional RPE”) multiplier is applied:

| Module            | Multiplier currently used |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Training Log**  | **1.10**                  |
| **Load Insights** | **1.25**                  |

Both modules are pulling the same RPE submissions, yet the different multipliers produce conflicting average emotional-load values in every downstream table, chart, and PDF export.

### Required fix

1. **Single source of truth**

   * Implement **one shared function** (e.g., `getEmotionalMultiplier(rpe: int) -> float`) and import it everywhere we calculate load.
   * Mapping must be linear from **1 → 1.00** up to **5 → 1.50**:

     ```
     multiplier = 1.00 + 0.125 × (rpe – 1)
     ```

     | RPE | Multiplier |
     | --- | ---------- |
     | 1   | 1.00       |
     | 2   | 1.125      |
     | 3   | 1.25       |
     | 4   | 1.375      |
     | 5   | 1.50       |

2. **Refactor all calculations**

   * Search the codebase for any hard-coded emotional multipliers (`1.1`, `1.25`, etc.) and replace them with the shared function.
   * Re-calculate stored values where we persisted emotional load in the database or cache. (Batch script or migration as needed.)

3. **Synchronise visualisations**

   * Regenerate every dashboard, chart, and report (Training Log, Load Insights, weekly/seasonal summaries) after the data is corrected.
   * Confirm that the same session now shows identical emotional-load values across all screens.

4. **Regression tests**

   * Add unit tests for the new `getEmotionalMultiplier` function.
   * Add integration tests that compute emotional load for a sample session and assert equality between Training Log and Load Insights outputs.

Once this is merged and redeployed, users will see consistent emotional-load metrics everywhere.

Thanks!
