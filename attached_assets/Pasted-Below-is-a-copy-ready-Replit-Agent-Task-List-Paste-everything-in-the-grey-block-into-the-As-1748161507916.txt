Below is a **copy-ready ‚ÄúReplit Agent Task List.‚Äù**
Paste everything in the grey block into the **Ask AI** side-panel of your *SportsMindTracker* Repl and press **Send**.
The agent will place **High Risk ‚ñ∏ Sick/Injured ‚ñ∏ AI Recommendations** side-by-side in a single, evenly-spaced row‚Äîwhile still stacking them gracefully on very small phones.

# üöÄ  Replit Agent Task ‚Äì Compact 3-button row (High-Risk, Sick/Injured, AI Recommendations)
# Repo: https://replit.com/@e89030922661/SportsMindTracker

## 1. Identify component
These three cards live inside **Coach Dashboard** under `src/pages/coach/MainMetrics.tsx`
(the High-Risk & Sick/Injured cards we just edited, plus the existing AI Recommendations card).

## 2. Wrap cards in a responsive 3-column grid
### 2.1 Add container class
Locate the JSX block where the three cards are rendered (currently two red cards + one lime).  
Replace the surrounding `div` with:

```tsx
<section
  className="grid gap-3
             grid-cols-1
             sm:grid-cols-2
             md:grid-cols-3">
  {/* High-Risk card */}
  {/* Sick/Injured card */}
  {/* AI Recommendations card */}
</section>
````

### 2.2 Ensure each card grows evenly

Add `className="h-full"` to each `<Card>` so they match heights when in one row:

```tsx
<Card className="bg-red-600/80 h-full" ...> ‚Ä¶ </Card>
```

(repeat for Sick/Injured and AI cards).

### 2.3 Remove external margins

If any of the three cards have `mt-4`, `mb-4`, or similar, delete those so the grid gap handles spacing.

## 3. Mobile overflow safeguard

Phones narrower than **360 px** may still wrap; to keep them in a single scrollable line on extra-small screens, add:

```tsx
<section
  className="flex md:grid gap-3 overflow-x-auto
             md:overflow-visible
             md:grid-cols-3">
```

(That line replaces the grid above; it behaves as flex-row < md, grid ‚â• md.)

## 4. Testing checklist

1. **Desktop (‚â• 768 px)** ‚Äì three cards sit in one row, equal width & height.
2. **Standard mobile (‚â• 375 px)** ‚Äì still one row (scrolls horizontally if needed).
3. **Very small mobile (320 px)** ‚Äì user can side-scroll the row; no layout break.
4. Clicking any card still triggers its original navigation / modal.

## 5. Commit message

> style(dashboard): arrange High-Risk, Sick/Injured & AI cards into single responsive row

# End of agent task

```

### What happens

* Grid/flex utilities (`gap-3`, `grid-cols-3`, `overflow-x-auto`) are pure Tailwind, so no extra CSS files.  
* Height equalisation (`h-full`) keeps the lime ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù card from stretching taller than the two red cards.  

Send the task to the agent, reload your preview, and you‚Äôll see the three compact buttons lined up neatly in one row.
