I’m working on a Replit app that tracks some personal metrics (things like self-control diary entries, RPE logs, and a dashboard of stats). I would like to export this data into a Google Sheets spreadsheet, with each data type on its own tab, so I can have a backup and analyze it in Sheets. I’m not sure about the best way to implement this and would love some advice. My app was originally front-end focused, and I’m not sure if it has a backend or persistent storage set up yet. I might need to add a way to store the data (perhaps using Replit’s built-in database) so that it can be sent to Google Sheets. What I want is either:
– A daily automatic export (once every 24 hours, e.g., at midnight) of all new data to Google Sheets, or
– A live sync where whenever a user adds something, it updates the Google Sheet immediately. I’m leaning towards a once-per-day export for simplicity, but I’m open to suggestions on what’s more reliable. I have been reading about using the Google Sheets API (with a service account JSON in Replit Secrets) vs. using a webhook or a tool like Zapier to send data to the sheet. I also saw Replit now has Scheduled Deployments (cron jobs) which might help with the daily timing. My questions:
What’s the best practice for integrating a Replit app with Google Sheets? Is using the gspread library (or Google’s API client) recommended, or is there a Replit-specific integration I should use?
If I go with a daily scheduled export, what’s the best way to schedule it on Replit? I don’t see the Scheduled Deployments option in my Replit UI – is this feature available to everyone, or should I use an external service to hit my app on a schedule?
If I try real-time updates, are there any pitfalls I should be aware of (like Replit shutting down the repl if idle, or hitting Google’s rate limits)?
Finally, if there are any code examples or templates for sending data to Google Sheets from Replit (especially handling the auth and credentials securely), that would be super helpful!
I appreciate any guidance. I want to implement this feature without breaking my core app, so any tips on keeping it modular would be great. Thank you in advance for your help!
