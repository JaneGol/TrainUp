Feature and Logic Update Request – Load Insights Section (Coach Interface)

Description:

Please update the Load Insights section in the coach interface according to the following specifications.

1. Training Load Calculation
Training Load should be calculated as:
**Training Load = RPE × Training Duration (in minutes)**

If the athlete submits RPE but the coach has not entered training duration, use a default duration of 70 minutes.

If the athlete has two training sessions in one day, their Training Loads should be summed for the day.

2. Training Load Chart (Bar Chart)
Display a single bar per day showing the total Training Load.

X-axis: Date

Y-axis: Total daily load

Use stacked colors within each bar to represent different types of training (e.g., field, gym, game) for that day.

This chart should clearly show training load dynamics over time.

Add filter options to view data for the past:

7 days

14 days

30 days

60 days

3. ACWR Chart (Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio)
Implement an ACWR line chart below or alongside the Training Load chart.

ACWR Logic:
Acute Load = average daily load over the past 7 days

Chronic Load = average daily load over the past 28 days

ACWR = Acute Load / Chronic Load

Add Risk Zones to the Chart:
ACWR < 0.8 – Undertraining zone (e.g., blue)

0.8 – 1.3 – Optimal Load zone (e.g., green)

ACWR > 1.3 – Injury Risk zone (e.g., red)

4. Design & Scope Limitations
Do not change anything else in the application.

Preserve the current design, layout, colors, and visual style exactly as they are.

This update should only apply to the Load Insights section, and only as described above.

Acceptance Criteria:

Training Load is calculated and displayed correctly.

Default duration logic functions as expected.

Daily loads are summed and displayed as single bars with color-coded segments.

Filters work correctly for the selected timeframes.

ACWR chart is calculated properly and includes clearly labeled risk zones.

No other functionality or design elements are modified.
